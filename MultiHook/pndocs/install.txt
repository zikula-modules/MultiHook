Copy the MultiHook folder to your Postnuke's modules folder, regenerate the
modules list in the admin panel, initialize and activate it.
Copy the modules/MultiHook/pnjavascript/ajax folder to your PostNuke's javascript folder.
For further changes see the chapter "Ajax support".

Do not forget to activate the MultiHook for the modules you want to use it with, like
pnForum or Pagesetter.

If present, the links stored in AutoLinks will be copied to the MultiHook
tables.

You can now add links, acronyms and abbreviations in the admin panel or by selecting
text while pressing the CTRL-button on every page inside PN.


Internet Explorer special trick:
--------------------------------
IE cannot (sigh...) handle the abbr tag correctly (or better said: it cannot
handle it correctly at all). We need a special css trick to make this
possible. Add this

abbr, acronym, span.abbr
{
    cursor: help;
    border-bottom: 1px dashed #000;
}

to your stylesheet files.

The abbr tag created will look like this:

<abbr title="longlonglong"><span class="abbr" title="longlonglong">short</span></abbr>

So it will work on IE and not break Mozilla or other Gecko based browsers.

External Links
--------------
MultiHook can add special markup for external links. For this feature you can (and
should) specify a css class in the configuration, e.g. externallink.

The css declaration in your style.css / styleNN.css can look like:

a.externallink {
    padding-left:  14px;
    font-size: 11px;
    background: url('../../../modules/MultiHook/pnimages/extlink.gif') no-repeat bottom left;
}
a:hover.externallink {
    padding-left:  14px;
    font-size: 11px;
    background: url('../../../modules/MultiHook/pnimages/extlink.gif') no-repeat bottom left;
}

This adds the image extlink.gif to the left of the created link. Please note that
the path to the image file is relative to the place of the css file used. Without
the a:hover the image would disappear in IE when the mouse is over the link
(sigh, again IE..).

Make sure that your target links are absolute, not relative. Linking to www.pn-cms.de will lead to
http://www.yourdomain.com/www.pn-cms.de although the a-tag looks correct in the page source.
This is not a bug in MultiHook, but the normal behaviour if a browser does not reckognize a fully
qualified url.

Ajax support
------------
Since version 2.0 MultiHook uses Ajax for easier adding and manipulating of data.

********************
*** Important note for users upgrading from MultiHook 2.0: Since 3.0 prototype.js
*** has to be present in the <PostNuke-Root>/javascript/ajax folder. You can simply
*** copy the ajax subfolder in modules/MultiHook/javascript to <PostNuke-Root>/javascript.
*** This is a preparation for PN .8.0.0.
*** When using pnForum >2.6 (or maybe other prototype enabled modules too) this is not necessary
*** because you already have <PostNuke-Root>/javascript/ajax - just make sure that you have the
*** latest version of prototype.js
********************

If you want to use this feature, your PostNuke theme has to be prepared for
this and you have to enable javascript in your browser.
Copy modules/MultiHook/pntemplates/plugins/function.multihookhelper.php to your
modules/Xanthia/plugins folder and change your theme templates:

<... some code ...>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="modules/MultiHook/pnstyle/style.css" />
</head>
<body>
<... lots of code ...>
<!--[ multihookhelper ]-->
</body>
</html>

The multihookhelper plugin adds the necessary javascript and hidden divs if the users has min.
ACCESS_ADD permissions for MultiHook.

In non-Xanthiathemes (legacy, AT...) you can call

    $multihookhelper = pnModFunc('MultiHook', 'admin', 'helper'));

to retrieve the HTML in $multihookhelper and show where you want (which in fact is what the
plugin does too).

You can now select text portions of your page. When you press CTRL when releasing the mouse button
at the end of the selection process, a popup window will appear. Without CTRL you can copy and
paste the text as before.

If you do not want to use Ajax you can still use the normal admin panel for adding and changing
the data.
